# Puter desktop app
**We are designing a Puter desktop application üåêüöÄ**

**App created by https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start.git**
# Features
1)Desktop app

2)Self-Host

3)Linux/Windows/macOS

# Explaining the functions
**Create window (800 x 800)**
```javascript
function createWindow () {
  // Crea la finestra del browser
  const win = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 800,
    webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: false // Disabilita l'integrazione di Node.js nella pagina web
    }
  });
```
**Open http://puter.localhost:4100/**

<h6>You can also change the domain to https://puter.com/ instead of http://puter.localhost:4100/</h6>

```javascript
  win.loadURL('http://puter.localhost:4100/');
```
**When electron is ready it creates the window**
```javascript
app.whenReady().then(createWindow);
```
**Kill app when windows are closed (except on macOS)**
```javascript
app.on('window-all-closed', () => {
  if (process.platform !== 'darwin') {
    app.quit();
  }
});
```
**On macOS, searches for the app window when clicked and the app is in the background**
```Javascript
app.on('activate', () => {
  if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) {
    createWindow();
  }
});
```
